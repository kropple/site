&#x20;**Token Merger**

The **token merger is now in effect, with the Gnosis Chain renaming underway.** During the transition you may see the chain referred to as xDai Chain or Gnosis Chain. The underlying chain functionality **is not impacted** by this merger. STAKE staking will continue until May 31, 2022.

* [â™» STAKE can be swapped now for GNO](for-stakers/stake-gno-swap.md).

## Gnosis Stable Chain

The Gnosis chain is a stable payments EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) blockchain designed for fast and inexpensive transactions. The chain uses a unique dual-token model; [xDai ](for-users/get-xdai-tokens/)is a stable token used for transactions, payments, and fees, and [STAKE](for-stakers/stake-token/) currently supports the underlying [POSDAO Proof-of-Stake](for-validators/posdao-whitepaper.md) consensus. **The PoS protection model will change once the** [**Gnosis Beacon Chain**](https://docs.gnosischain.com) **is Implemented, and GNO will protect the chain.**

## **Developers**

Development on GC is easy and intuitive for Ethereum developers. GC is an EVM chain, and smart contracts can be written and deployed in exactly the same way simply by setting a [different RPC endpoint.](for-developers/developer-resources/#json-rpc-endpoints)

Any contract that works on the Ethereum mainnet can be redeployed to the Gnosis chain. Transaction costs are minimized, and all fees and transactions are paid with a single token, xDai. **Many tools supporting Ethereum development** are compatible with GC, including:

* [TheGraph](https://thegraph.com)
* [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co)
* [Remix](https://remix-project.org)
* [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com)
* [BlockNative](https://www.blocknative.com)
* [Gnosis Safe MultiSig](https://gnosis-safe.io)
* [Dune Analytics](https://duneanalytics.com/home)
* Many more......

## **Why Gnosis/xDai?**

* âœ…Fast transaction times (5 seconds) & low transaction fees (500 tx for $.01).
* âœ…Digital cash. A stable chain is ideal for real world value exchange where 1 xDai = 1 US Dollar.
* âœ…A stable token for transactions & gas fees.
* âœ…A green, energy-efficient and [ecologically aware](about-gc/news-and-information/xdai-energy-efficiency/) blockchain network.
* âœ…Permissionless delegated Proof-Of-Stake based consensus with public [POSDAO](for-validators/posdao-whitepaper.md).
* âœ…Wide-ranging Community Support (see [xDai Validator Organizations](for-validators/about-xdai-validators/original-xdai-validators/)).
* âœ…Extreme usability with tools like [Burner Wallet](for-users/wallets/burner-wallet/) & [Burner Wallet 2](for-users/wallets/burner-wallet-2.md).
* âœ…Growing ecosystem designed to support stable person-to-person transactions, micro transactions, [conference currencies](about-gc/use-cases/cryptocurrency-for-events-and-conferences/), [community currencies](about-gc/use-cases/community-currencies.md), DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, games and more.
* âœ…Full-featured  [BlockScout Explorer](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet).
* âœ…On-chain, decentralized [Random Number Generator](for-developers/on-chain-random-numbers/).
* âœ…Smart Contract, DApp & toolset compatibility with other Ethereum-based chains like Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, BSC and others.
* âœ…Experiencing the [magic of crypto](about-gc/news-and-information/media-articles/crypto-influencers-on-xdai.md#anthony-pompliano) for the first time!
