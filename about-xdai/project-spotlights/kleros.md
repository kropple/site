# Kleros

The Kleros decentralized arbitration protocol is now on xDai! Anyone can become a Juror and fees are set and paid with xDai, meaning juror fees are stable and compensation is predictable.

Projects can also [integrate with Kleros](https://kleros.io/integrations) to receive arbitration services related to their protocols. Use cases include dispute resolution, content moderation, and token curation.

To start with Kleros Court, set your MetaMask to xDai and go to [https://court.kleros.io/](https://court.kleros.io/). You will need some PNK tokens on xDai for staking, and can bridge them from Ethereum using the OmniBridge.
