# AoX: Arbitrum on GC

Arbitrum has been deployed to Gnosis Chain called **AoX**! This unofficial instance was deployed for research and development purposes, cultivating a broad ecosystem for  developers and users.

We are currently working on configs and bridge installation, [Blockscout is already configured for AoX](https://blockscout.com/xdai/aox/). Look for more info and instructions coming soon.

For information on Arbitrum and usage basics, see the [Arbitrum docs](https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/developer\_quickstart). Note that AoX is still being finalized, and some functionality is not yet available.&#x20;

## Deposits to AoX

Simple deposit functionality for users / bridge implementation is still in development. Devs can use the following ABI to call the  `depositEth` method. Use 0 for `maxSubmissionCost` and attach an amount of xDai tokens to the transaction. It may take several minutes for execution finalization.&#x20;

* [Deposit Example Transaction](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/tx/0x2827e6b8c0c16b1a924910fb98488ebf2fb49303814773b252b16b7f67c0a83e)
* ABI :arrow\_down:&#x20;

```
[
  {
    "inputs":[
      {
        "internalType":"uint256",
        "name":"maxSubmissionCost",
        "type":"uint256"
      }
    ],
    "name":"depositEth",
    "outputs":[
      {
        "internalType":"uint256",
        "name":"",
        "type":"uint256"
      }
    ],
    "stateMutability":"payable",
    "type":"function"
  }
]
```

### BlockScout Deposit Example

1. Connect your wallet to blockscout.
2. Go to [the Write Proxy tab in the AoX Inbox contract](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/address/0x9Ab4bf8A231854ce5983C5fd69664859F717359D/write-proxy)
3. In the `depositEth` method
   1. Enter 0 for maxSubmissionCost field
   2. Enter the amount of xDai to deposit
   3. Click `Write` and confirm in MetaMask

Once completed, it may take several minutes for the transaction to arrive at your address on the rollup. Switch to Arbitrum on xDai in Metamask to view the deposit.

### Contract Deployment

#### Hardhat

To adjust deployment, simply use the xDai Arbitrum RPC url in your `hardhat.config.ts`:

```
module.exports = {
  solidity: '0.7.3',
  networks: {
    arbitrum: {
      url: 'https://arbitrum.xdaichain.com/',
      gasPrice: 0,
    },
  },
}
```

{% hint style="info" %}
For more info on Arbitrum and usage basics, please see the [Arbitrum docs](https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/developer\_quickstart). You can work with Arbitrum on xDai as you would on Ethereum.&#x20;
