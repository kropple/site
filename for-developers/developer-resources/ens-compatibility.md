# ENS compatibility

ENS is not currently deployed on xDai, it is only on Ethereum and some testnets, however there are ways applications can use ENS services to display names. [Nifty.Ink](../../about-xdai/project-spotlights/nifty.ink.md) is an example application that uses ENS names to identify artists on the platform.

This article by Makoto Inoue describes a simple method to get an ENS address on mainnet and display on xDai.

In addition, a secure off-chain data retrieval method called [Durin](https://github.com/Arachnid/EIPs/blob/durin/EIPS/eip-3668.md) is in development which will allow users to access a “Gateway URL” which retrieves data from the specific chain.
