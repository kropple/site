# ERC20 Test Token Faucet

The [ERC20 Token Faucet](https://erc20faucet.com) by [peppersec](https://peppersec.com) provides a sleek and easy interface for ERC20 test token creation.&#x20;

The faucet can quickly generate any number of FAU tokens directly from a web interface. These tokens are then available for developers to test smart contract applications and any other token transfer functionality.

### Prerequisites

* Network wallet address loaded with enough native currency (xDai) to cover the transaction.
* Web3 wallet interface such as [MetaMask](../../for-users/wallets/metamask/metamask-setup.md) or NiftyWallet. In this tutorial we use [NiftyWallet](https://forum.poa.network/t/nifty-wallet-is-back-on-the-chrome-store/2408).

ERC20 Token Faucet can also be used with [Portis](https://www.portis.io) or [Squarelink](https://squarelink.com).
{% endhint %}

### Steps

1\) Go to [https://erc20faucet.com/](https://erc20faucet.com).  Check that your web3 wallet (ie NiftyWallet) is connected to the xDai network. If you change this after step 3, you will need to reconnect.

2\) Click **Connect**.

3\) Select **Metamask**

4\) Once selected, the web interface will populate with your Address, Network and Balance information.

* 1\) Select the **Amount of tokens** you would like to create.
* 2\) Click the **Mint Free Tokens** button.

5\) Your web3 wallet interface should open. Check the transaction and click **Submit** to confirm. You will see a Success message if the transaction is successful.

6\) The tokens have been minted on your address! To view them, you will need to add the Token Address to your wallet.

* A) Copy the Token Address, open your NiftyWallet, and click Add Token in the Tokens tab.

![Add token to your wallet](<../../.gitbook/assets/Add Token.png>)

* B) Select the Custom tab, and paste in the Token Address from the website. The Token Symbol and Decimals should populate automatically. Click **Add**.

* C) You should see your new FAU balance in the wallet.

To mint FAU tokens on another network, such as POA network, simply switch the network you are connected to in your web3 wallet, and follow the process above.
{% endhint %}

### Quick Video

This video shows the steps above using the POA network as a demo and a previous version of the ERC20 Token Faucet. Steps are identical, the only difference is the wallet must be connected to the **Gnosis Chain Network**.
