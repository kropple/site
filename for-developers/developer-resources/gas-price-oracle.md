# Gas Price Oracle

The BlockScout gas price api endpoint shows a recommended gas price for average, fast and slow transactions based on recently accepted transactions. Users can decide whether to increase the gas price to speed up a transaction or input a lower gas price which may take longer but is still likely to be successful.

* Endpoint: [https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/api/v1/gas-price-oracle](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/api/v1/gas-price-oracle)
* Response calculated for **previous 200 blocks** and **updated every 30 seconds**.
* Response criteria for average, fast and slow gas estimates follow[ EthGasStation recommendations](https://github.com/ethgasstation/gasstation-express-oracle/blob/master/gasExpress.py#L16-L18).

### Example response
