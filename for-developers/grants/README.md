# Grants for building on Gnosis Chain

**Wave 1 of the Grants Program is now accepting early applications!** We are looking to help support projects that bring new features and functionality to the Gnosis Chain.  If you have a new idea, a new implementation, or an exciting use-case, we want to hear about it! To start we are collecting project ideas and will be implementing a follow-up process soon.

We are especially interested in experimental projects, new games, DAO initiatives, applications for new crytpo users, NFTs, DeFi apps, projects that support [current projects](../../about-gc/project-spotlights/), and new categories we haven't even thought of yet!

GC is a place for exploration where new ideas can flourish thanks to the stable transaction model and fast transtion. We would love to help bring your project to life and introduce new users to the next generation of DApps and forward-facing projects on the Gnosis Chain!
