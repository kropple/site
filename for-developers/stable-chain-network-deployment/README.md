# Stable Chain Network Deployment

{% hint style="info" %}
**Stable Chain Deployment Instructions (AWS)**

These advanced instructions are for developers interested in deploying their own GC-like (or other ERC20 Stable Token) Network. They are not required to run or interact with the Gnosis Chain. This process is a bit involved, so grab a :coffee: and settle in!
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note: These instructions were created in 2019 and may contain outdated information, including references to the xDai Chain (now called the Gnosis Chain).\
