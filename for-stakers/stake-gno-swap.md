## Instructions

STAKE is available to swap with GNO on either the xDai Network (soon to be named Gnosis Chain) or the Ethereum Network. Instructions are similar for both Networks, you will connect your Wallet to the network you are swapping on, then proceed with the swap.&#x20;

You will need an amount of ETH  (when swapping on Ethereum) or xDai (when swapping on xDai) to pay gas fees and complete the swap.

{% hint style="info" %}
Instructions below are for swapping on the xDai chain ([STAKE from Ethereum](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/token/0xb7D311E2Eb55F2f68a9440da38e7989210b9A05e/token-transfers) to [GNO from Ethereum](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/token/0x9C58BAcC331c9aa871AFD802DB6379a98e80CEdb/token-transfers)). To swap STAKE on the Ethereum chain, connect your wallet to Ethereum and follow the same process.

### 3) Select xDai chain from the dropdown menu.

If using on Ethereum and connected to xDai, use the same dropdown to switch between chains. STAKE values will be shown for the chain you are connected to.

### 4) Enter the amount you want to swap

Click **Convert All** to exchange all. After entering an amount, click Confirm to proceed.

You will need a small amount of xDai to process the transaction. If needed, you can get some at the community faucet at [https://xdai-app.herokuapp.com/faucet](https://xdai-app.herokuapp.com/faucet)

### 6) Transaction is initiated and should be completed shortly.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note: If swapping on xDai and you want to send GNO to an exchange, it is vital to bridge GNO to Ethereum first using the [Omnibridge](https://omni.xdaichain.com/bridge). If you send GNO on xDai directly to an exchange address, your tokens WILL BE LOST.
{% endhint %}

From this final screen you can:

1. Check Transaction Details: Click to view In BlockScout (xDai) or Etherscan (Ethereum).
2. Add GNO to MetaMask: Click to add GNO token to your MetaMask wallet.
