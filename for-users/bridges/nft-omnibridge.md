* **Network Switcher.** There is current support for 2 bridges, Rinkeby<->xDai and Mainnet<->xDai. Switching to the appropriate network in MetaMask will also influence the display.
* **History Tab**. Shows previous transactions and any available claims.
* **Advanced.** Use to set an alternate receiving address on the destination chain (send to another address)
* **ERC-721 & ERC-1155 Support**. Scroll down to see any ERC-1155 Tokens owned by the connected address. You can transfer multiple ERC-1155s with a single bridge tx.
