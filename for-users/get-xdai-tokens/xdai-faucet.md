# xDai Faucets

## OmniBridge Faucet

The OmniBridge faucet now automatically deposits a small amount of xDai ($0.01) to users bridging tokens from Ethereum or BSC. This is enough to start making transactions. If more is needed, bridged tokens can be [swapped on a DEX](../../about-gc/project-spotlights/#defi) for additional xDai. Only empty wallets (non-contract wallets with a 0 xDai balance) receive xDai when bridging.&#x20;

Example transaction: [https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/tx/0x4f071fda836ca2fb50854c80851da7040776700247e22f9c9f99d980e74eb527](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/tx/0x4f071fda836ca2fb50854c80851da7040776700247e22f9c9f99d980e74eb527)
