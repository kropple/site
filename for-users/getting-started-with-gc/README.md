description: 5 steps to getting going on Gnosis Chain
---

# Getting Started with GC

## 1) Set your Chain ID and RPC

To get started on GC, you will need to setup your externally owned address (wallet address) to access the Gnosis chain. **You can use the same address you use on Ethereum**, but the chain id and RPC must point to GC (formerly xDai - services may still refer to the chain this way, so be sure to check). &#x20;

* You can use [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org) to quickly add to MetaMask (Check xDai Chain) or see the [MetaMask Setup tutorial](../wallets/metamask/metamask-setup.md) for example steps and configuration.
* If desired, you can also use a [different RPC endpoint](../../for-developers/developer-resources/#json-rpc-endpoints) or even [setup your own node to connect](../../for-developers/install-xdai-client/) with.
* See the [wallets section](../wallets/) for additional wallets that support GC(xDai) out of the box and don't require configuration.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Default chain settings:** Network Name: Gnosis Chain,  New RPC URL: [https://rpc.gnosischain.com](https://rpc.gnosischain.com), Chain ID: 0x64, Symbol: xDai, Block Explorer URL: [https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/)
{% endhint %}

## 2) Get Some xDai - the stable transaction token for the chain

* Try one of these faucets:
  * Faucet #1 - [https://xdai-app.herokuapp.com/faucet](https://xdai-app.herokuapp.com/faucet)&#x20;
  * Faucet #2 - [https://stakely.io/faucet/gnosis-chain-xdai](https://stakely.io/faucet/gnosis-chain-xdai)
  * Faucet #3 - [https://faucet.prussia.dev/xdai](https://faucet.prussia.dev/xdai)
* Convert Dai on Ethereum to xDai with the [xDai bridge](../bridges/converting-xdai-via-bridge/) or use the [Rubic.exchange ](https://rubic.exchange)bridge.
* [Purchase xDai directly from AscendEX (BitMax)](https://bitmax.io/en/basic/cashtrade-spottrading/usdt/xdai)
* With Fiat using the [Ramp Network](../get-xdai-tokens/buying-xdai-with-fiat/ramp-network.md) or [Mt Pelerin](../get-xdai-tokens/buying-xdai-with-fiat/mt-pelerin.md)
* Ask on [xDai Discord](https://discord.gg/mPJ9zkq) or [Telegram](https://t.me/xdaistable) ... friends may be willing to help with small amounts :blush:&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
A new [OmniBridge faucet ](../get-xdai-tokens/xdai-faucet.md#omnibridge-faucet) provides users with a small amount (0.01) of xDai when bridging tokens from Ethereum or BSC. This is enough to start transacting on the chain, and more can be obtained through swapping bridged tokens for xDai[ on DEXs](../../about-gc/project-spotlights/#defi). Only empty wallets receive xDai.
{% endhint %}

## 3) BlockScout is your Home Base

BlockScout is the gateway for exploring activities on the chain and accessing token and contract information. In the Apps menu you can find links to bridges, transaction monitoring tools, staking and more. You can explore the various bridged tokens, view daily transactions, active accounts and other on-chain happenings.

## 4) Bridges Connecting Ecosystems

You can move tokens between GC and Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain and others using the various available bridges. See the bridges section for more details on each bridge.  If you move a token to GC, be sure to add the custom token to your wallet. Clicking the fox icon in BlockScout or the Omnibridge will quickly add the token.

* [xDai Bridge](https://bridge.xdaichain.com): xDai -Dai transfer with Ethereum. [Rubic.exchange](https://rubic.exchange) also provides a Dai -> xDai bridge interface.
* [OmniBridge](https://omni.xdaichain.com): All ERC20 token transfers between xDai, Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain.

## 5) Explore and Enjoy

* Find [Projects and DApps](../../about-gc/project-spotlights/), including games, DeFi apps, NFT marketplaces, DAOs and much more.
* Helpful on-chain tools for users are referenced [here](../applications/). For developers, see the [development tools and resources](../../for-developers/developer-resources/) section.
* If you are interested in participating in governance and shaping the future of xDai, see the [STAKE Token](../../for-stakers/stake-token/) and [Staking on xDai ](../../for-stakers/staking-protocol/)sections to get involved as a delegator or participate in community governance.
