# GNO Token

GNO is the staking token used by validators of the [Gnosis Beacon Chain](https://docs.gnosischain.com). This chain will provide consensus security following the merge between the Gnosis Chain (formerly xDai) and the Gnosis Beacon Chain.

### Getting GNO

* GNO is available on various DeFi protocols and exchanges including Binance. [Complete list of GNO markets](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/gnosis)
* GNO is available on Ethereum or the Gnosis Chain. To be used for staking, GNO must first be moved to the Gnosis Chain. [The Omnibridge allows users to move GNO (and many other ERC20s) between chains.](https://omni.xdaichain.com/bridge)
* STAKE can be swapped for GNO on Ethereum or GC. Swapping will be available until the end of Q2 2022. [Details on the STAKE/GNO swap](../../for-stakers/stake-token/stake-gno-swap.md)

### Staking with GNO

### GNO Rewards

* Validators of the Gnosis Beacon Chain receive rewards based on the number of validators protecting the chain. [More on rewards and percentages](../../for-validators/gnosis-chain-validators.md).
* GNO holders are also entitled to airdrops from projects incubated on Gnosis. [More on airdrops and incentives](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gno-utility-overview/2344).

### GNO Distribution & Burn

* 1.5M GNO are currently in circulation out of 10M total supply
* An additional 0.5M GNO are vested linearly to Gnosis Ltd over 5 years starting Nov 2020
* Further 8M GNO are vested linearly to Gnosis DAO over 8 years starting Nov 2020
* 285,398 GNO will be taken out of the already vested GNO to GnosisDAO to allow the STAKE merger
* 75,000 GNO will be taken out of the already vested GNO to Gnosis Ltd to pay outstanding debt
* Both together will increase the circulating supply of GNO to 1.86M GNO
* The merger proposal also allocates 400k GNO to ecosystem development. This should be taken out of the vested GNO contract on an on-demand basis.
* To pay for the validator rewards on Gnosis Chain, additional GNO has to be reserved. Given a likely inflation rate of 1.32%, it is unlikely that more than 300K GNO will be needed in the foreseeable future (10 years). It might as well be the case that GNO will be deflationary at some point in the future thanks to EIP-1559.
