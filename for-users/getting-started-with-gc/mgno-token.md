# mGNO token

To create a more accurate ETH-mirrored environment, a minimum of 32 tokens are used for staking purposes on the Gnosis Beacon Chain. The mGNO token is a metaToken similar to a wrapped token created for this purpose. During deposits, 1 GNO is automatically converted to 32 mGNO.[ The deposit process is detailed here](https://docs.gnosischain.com/validator-info/validator-deposits).
