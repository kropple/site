# Hardware Wallets: Ledger & Trezor

Hardware wallets support includes Ledger & Trezor. The easiest way to use these wallets is to use MetaMask:

1\) Connect [MetaMask to the xDai Network](metamask/metamask-setup.md).\
2\) Select Connect Hardware Wallet from the MetaMask Dropdown.

3\) Connect your hardware wallet and select the hardware wallet account you want to interact with.

4\) Once connected, your account will behave like any other MetaMask Account with the exception that you will sign and approve txs on your connected hardware device. As xDai is the native transactional token of the xDai chain, you may see xDai called ETH within the hardware wallet environment.&#x20;

## Ledger

There is not an "xDai" dedicated application, you will use the [Ethereum application](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005200009-Set-up-and-use-MyEtherWallet) to interact with xDai through MetaMask.  Be sure your ledger firmware is updated and you have setup [Ledger Live](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live/).

If interacting with a contract (for example claiming tokens with a bridge transfer), you will need to enable blind signing

1. Connect and unlock your Ledger device.
2. Open the **Ethereum (ETH)** application.
3. Press the right button to navigate to **Settings**. Then press both buttons to validate.\
   Your Ledger device displays **Blind Signing**.
4. Press both buttons to enable transaction blind signing. \
   The device displays **Enabled**. You're done.
5. Retry your transaction.

## Trezor

Once connected to the xDai network in MetaMask and your Trezor wallet, you will be forwarded to the [https://wallet.trezor.io](https://wallet.trezor.io/#/) interface to connect and complete transactions.
