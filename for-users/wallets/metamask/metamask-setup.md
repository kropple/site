# Metamask Setup

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note: Sending tokens to exchanges or other addresses you do not control may result in a loss of funds if the address is not supported by GC. For example, sending tokens to Coinbase, Trustwallet, etc directly from the xDai network.&#x20;

**Bridge to your address on Ethereum first, then transfer!**

* **xDai - Dai Bridge:** [http://bridge.xdaichain.com/](http://bridge.xdaichain.com)
* **OmniBridge (for all other ERC20 Tokens):** [https://omni.xdaichain.com/](https://omni.xdaichain.com)
{% endhint %}

## Setting up MetaMask for Gnosis Chain

{% hint style="warning" %}
Many sites still refer to the Gnosis Chain as the xDai Chain. Otherwise, processes are the same with an interchangeable chain name. &#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Quick Methods

1. [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org). Click xDai to add You may still need to add BlockScout as the Block Explorer.
2. [Sushiswap](https://app.sushi.com/swap). With MetaMask enabled on Ethereum, click on the network dropdown and select xDai. MetaMask will ask for approval to add the xDai chain.
{% endhint %}

## Manual Instructions

1\) Open Metamask, and select "Custom RPC" from the Network Dropdown.

2\) In the "Custom RPC" Settings, add in the Gnosis network details and click **Save**:

* Network Name: **Gnosis Chain**
* New RPC URL: [**https://rpc.gnosischain.com**](https://rpc.gnosischain.com)****
* Chain ID: **0x64**
* Symbol: **xDai**
* Block Explorer URL: [**https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet**](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/)



{% hint style="info" %}
Note: Chain ID 0x64 is the hexadecimal equivalent of 100, which is the xDai chain ID. MetaMask recently updated the ChainID to be a required field. When you update, you may need to reenter the Chain ID: 100, and it will be converted to a hexadecimal: 0x64**.**

**If you are having issues, try entering 100 for Chain ID and resaving the configuration.**
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If you'd prefer not to make these changes, [**Nifty Wallet** ](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nifty-wallet/jbdaocneiiinmjbjlgalhcelgbejmnid)provides a built-in xDai RPC.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Once you add the Gnosis Chain network, you will need xDai to pay for transactions. See [Getting xDai](../../get-xdai-tokens/) for more information.
{% endhint %}

## Adding Custom Tokens

When bridging tokens from Ethereum, BSC or elsewhere you may need to add the custom token to MetaMask to view it. **The address on GC will be different from the address on Ethereum or BSC.**

The easiest way is to click on the fox icon in BlockScout or OmniBridge for the token you are adding, then complete the process through the MetaMask popup.

If you want to add manually in MetaMask, go to **Assets** -> **Add Token**, Paste in the address (symbol and decimals should populate if you are connected to xDai) and save.
