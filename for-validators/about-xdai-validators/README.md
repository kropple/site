# About Validators

A validator runs a node that verifies transactions and finalizes blocks on the xDai chain. Each validator must provide the minimum STAKE collateral (2K STAKE) into their pool and setup a functional node to participate. They start as candidates, and have the chance to become validators each week when a new validator set is chosen.
