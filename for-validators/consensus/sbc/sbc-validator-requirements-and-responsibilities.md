# SBC Validator Requirements & Responsibilities

{% hint style="warning" %}
Staking is not yet available for the SBC. We will provide additional details about the process shortly.

If you are interested in becoming a beacon chain validator in the future, please [fill out this form](https://airtable.com/shrrzJsRLa767gpcQ) and we will contact you regarding next steps.

Before getting started, it is important to have an understanding of your responsibilities as a validator. As an ETH2-mirrored environment with lower stakes, validating on the SBC involves many of the same responsibilities as validating on ETH2. Educating and familiarizing yourself with the [Eth2 Launchpad Advisories](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/en/overview) is a good way to get up to speed quickly.

On SBC you can validate blocks with a more reasonable staking amount, providing security and receiving rewards (or penalties) as you would with Eth2. Primary points to consider:

* The validator deposit is a **non-reversible, one-way transaction**. Withdrawal will not be possible until the xDai merge occurs.
* You are **responsible for your node**, including ensuring uptime, correct behavior, and monitoring. If your node is not responding properly, or is displaying dishonest behavior (like running keys on 2 nodes at the same time), you will be penalized in the form of deposit slashing.
* You are **responsible for your keys** (deriving and storing your keys and mnemonic securely). If you lose, or your keys are compromised, there is no recourse to recover your funds.
* You provide decentralization and security for the network. **You are vital to the proper functioning of SBC**.

If you are ready to proceed, please see the technical prerequisites which include hardware requirements to get started.
