# Gnosis Chain Validators

Currently, POSDAO validators are still securing the Gnosis (formerly xDai) chain. POSDAO will be deprecated once the merge between the Gnosis and Gnosis Beacon Chain occurs. This is scheduled for 1 week prior to the Ethereum 2 merge.

{% hint style="success" %}
Gnosis Beacon Chain is open for new validators. [Learn more and start the process here](https://docs.gnosischain.com).

## Gnosis Beacon Chain Validator Rewards

The minimum requirement to run a validator is 1 GNO (staked as 32 mGNO tokens).  Rewards are based on the number of validators securing the chain.

| GNO staked | Validator reward percentage | Total GNO rewards |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | ----------------- |
| 4096       | 83.85%                      | 3434.496          |
